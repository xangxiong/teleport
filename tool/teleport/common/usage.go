  --roles=node,proxy,auth,app

  This flag tells Teleport which services to run. By default it runs auth,
  proxy, and node. In a production environment you may want to separate them.

  --token=xyz

  This token is needed to connect a node or web app to an auth server. Get it
  by running "tctl tokens add --type=node" or "tctl tokens add --type=app" to
  join an SSH server or web app to your cluster respectively. It's used once
  and ignored afterwards.

Examples:

> teleport start
  By default without any configuration, teleport starts running as a single-node
  cluster. It's the equivalent of running with --roles=node,proxy,auth

> teleport start --roles=node --auth-server=10.1.0.1 --token=xyz --nodename=db
  Starts a node named 'db' running in strictly SSH mode role, joining the cluster
  serviced by the auth server running on 10.1.0.1

> teleport start --roles=node --auth-server=10.1.0.1 --labels=db=master
  Same as the above, but the node runs with db=master label and can be connected
  to using that label in addition to its name.
