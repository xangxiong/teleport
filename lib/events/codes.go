package events

// There is no strict algorithm for picking an event code, however existing
// event codes are currently loosely categorized as follows:
//
//   - Teleport event codes start with "T" and belong in this const block.
//
//   - Related events are grouped starting with the same number.
//     eg: All user related events are grouped under 1xxx.
//
//   - Suffix code with one of these letters: I (info), W (warn), E (error).
