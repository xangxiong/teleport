Package reversetunnel provides interfaces for accessing remote clusters

	via reverse tunnels and directly.

	Proxy Cluster "A"                      Proxy Cluster "B"

Reverse tunnel is established from a cluster "B" Proxy
to the a cluster "A" proxy, and clients of the cluster "A"
can access servers of the cluster "B" via reverse tunnel connection,
even if the cluster "B" is behind the firewall.

# Multiple Proxies and Revese Tunnels

With multiple proxies behind the load balancer,
proxy agents will eventually discover and establish connections to all
proxies in cluster.

* Initially Proxy Agent connects to Proxy 1.
* Proxy 1 starts sending information about all available proxies
to the the Proxy Agent . This process is called "sending discovery request".

+----------+

	Proxy 2

* Agent will use the discovery request to establish new connections
and check if it has connected and "discovered" all the proxies specified

	in the discovery request.

* Assuming that load balancer uses fair load balancing algorithm,
agent will eventually discover and connect back to all the proxies.
