Package sqlbk implements a storage backend SQL databases.

The backend requires a Driver, which is an abstraction for communicating with a
specific database platforms such as PostgreSQL. A Driver opens a connection pool
that communicates with a database instance through a DB interface. A DB exposes
an interface to create transactions with cancellation through a Tx interface.

	Driver -> DB -> Tx

# Testing

Test a Driver implementation using the TestDriver package function. The test
will configure the driver for use with a test backend and execute the backend
test suite. See driver implementations for details about configuring tests.
