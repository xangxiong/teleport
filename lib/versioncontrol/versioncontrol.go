// as immutable, so normalization is never applied automatically. It is the responsibility of the
// consumers of this package to apply normalization when and where immutability is known to not
// be required (e.g. the 'teleport.Version' can and should always be normalized).

// comparable via `==`. version strings returned by this function should still only be compared
// via `semver.Compare`, or via the comparison methods on the Target type.
