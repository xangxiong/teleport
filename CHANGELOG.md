## 8.3.14

This release of Teleport contains multiple security, bug fixes and improvements.

### Escalation attack in agent forwarding

When setting up agent forwarding on the node, Teleport did not handle unix socket creation in a secure manner.

This could have given a potential attacker an opportunity to get Teleport to change arbitrary file permissions to the attacker’s user.

### Websockets CSRF

When handling websocket requests, Teleport did not verify that the provided Bearer token was generated for the correct user.

This could have allowed a malicious low privileged Teleport user to use a social engineering attack to gain higher privileged access on the same Teleport cluster.

### Denial of service in access requests

When accepting an access request, Teleport did not enforce the maximum request reason size.

This could allow a malicious actor to mount a DoS attack by creating an access request with a very large request reason.

## 8.3.3

This release of Teleport contains a security fix and multiple improvements and fixes.

### Trusted Clusters security fix

An attacker in possession of a valid Trusted Cluster join token could inject a
malicious CA into a Teleport cluster that would allow them to bypass root
cluster authorization and potentially connect to any node within the root
cluster.

For customers using Trusted Clusters, we recommend upgrading to one of the
patched releases listed below then revoking and rotating all Trusted Cluster
tokens. As a best practice, make sure that Trusted Cluster tokens have short
time-to-live and ideally are removed after being used once.

### Security fixes

As part of a routine security audit of Teleport, several security
vulnerabilities and miscellaneous issues were discovered. Below are the issues
found, their impact, and the components of Teleport they affect.

#### Insufficient authorization check in self-hosted MySQL database access

Teleport MySQL proxy engine did not handle internal MySQL protocol command that
allows to reauthenticate the active connection.

This could allow an attacker with a valid client certificate for a particular
database user to reauthenticate as a different MySQL user created using
`require x509` clause.

#### Insufficient authorization check in MongoDB database access

Teleport MongoDB proxy engine did not implement processing for all possible
MongoDB wire protocol messages.

This could allow an attacker with a valid client certificate to connect to the
database in a way that would prevent Teleport from enforcing authorization
check on the database names.

#### Authorization bypass in application access

When proxying a websocket connection, Teleport did not check for a successful
connection upgrade response from the target application.

In scenarios where Teleport proxy is located behind a load balancer, this could
result in the load balancer reusing the cached authenticated connection for
future unauthenticated requests.

#### Actions

For Database Access users we recommend upgrading database agents that handle
connections to self-hosted MySQL servers and MongoDB clusters.

For Application Access users we recommend upgrading application agents.

Upgrades should follow the normal Teleport upgrade procedure:
https://goteleport.com/teleport/docs/admin-guide/#upgrading-teleport.

## 8.0.1

This release of Teleport contains multiple improvements, bug fixes and a security fix.

* Mitigated [CVE-2021-43565](https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/2AR1sKiM-Qs) by updating golang.org/x/crypto. [#9203](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/9203)
* Desktop Access: Windows Desktop discovery can now be customized by specifying a base DN and LDAP filters to search. [#9201](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/9201)
* Added Azure PostgreSQL and MySQL managed identity authentication support to database access. [#9185](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/9185)
* Added support for RBAC "where" condition for active sessions. [#9076](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/9076)
* Added hint to `tsh` that MFA is not supported on Windows. [#9198](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/9198)

* Made Teleport startup more resilient to the presence of invalid roles in the backend. [#9105](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/9105)

## 8.0.0

Teleport 8.0 is a major release of Teleport that contains new features, improvements, and bug fixes.

### New Features

#### Windows Desktop Access Preview

Teleport 8.0 includes a preview of the Windows Desktop Access feature, allowing
users passwordless login to Windows Desktops via any modern web browser.

Teleport users can connect to Active Directory enrolled Windows hosts running
Windows 10, Windows Server 2012 R2 and newer Windows versions.

To try this feature yourself, check out our
[Getting Started Guide](https://goteleport.com/docs/ver/8.0/desktop-access/getting-started/).

Review the Desktop Access design in:

- [RFD #33](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/blob/master/rfd/0033-desktop-access.md)
- [RFD #34](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/blob/master/rfd/0034-desktop-access-windows.md)
- [RFD #35](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/blob/master/rfd/0035-desktop-access-windows-authn.md)
- [RFD #37](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/blob/master/rfd/0037-desktop-access-protocol.md)

#### TLS Routing

In TLS routing mode all client connections are wrapped in TLS and multiplexed on
a single Teleport proxy port.

TLS routing can be enabled by including the following auth service configuration:

```yaml
auth_service:
  proxy_listener_mode: multiplex
  ...
```

and setting proxy configuration version to `v2` to prevent legacy listeners from
being created:

```yaml
version: v2
proxy_service:
  ...
```

#### AWS CLI

Teleport application access extends AWS console support to CLI . Users are able
to log into their AWS console using `tsh app login` and use `tsh aws` commands
to interact with AWS APIs.

See more info in the [documentation](https://goteleport.com/docs/ver/8.0/application-access/guides/aws-console/#step-8-using-aws-cli).

#### Application and Database Dynamic Registration

With dynamic registration users are able to manage applications and databases
without needing to update static YAML configuration or restart application or
database agents.

See dynamic registration guides for
[apps](https://goteleport.com/docs/ver/8.0/application-access/guides/dynamic-registration/)
and
[databases](https://goteleport.com/docs/ver/8.0/database-access/guides/dynamic-registration/).

#### RDS Automatic Discovery

With RDS auto discovery Teleport database agents can automatically discover RDS
instances and Aurora clusters in an AWS account.

See updated
[RDS guide](https://goteleport.com/docs/ver/8.0/database-access/guides/rds/) for
more information.

#### WebAuthn

WebAuthn support enables Teleport users to use modern second factor options,
including Apple FaceID and TouchID.

In addition, the Teleport Web UI includes new second factor management tools,
enabling users to configure and update their second factor devices via their
web browser.

Lastly, our UI becomes more secure by requiring an additional second factor
confirmation for certain privileged actions (editing roles for second factor
confirmation, for example).

### Improvements

* Added support for [CockroachDB](https://www.cockroachlabs.com) to Database
  Access. [#8505](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/8505)
* Reduced network utilization on large clusters during login.
  [#8471](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/8471)
* Added metrics and added the ability for `tctl top` to show network utilization
  for resource propagation.
  [#8338](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/8338)
  [#8603](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/8603)
  [#8491](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/8491)
* Added support for account recovery and cancellation.
  [#6769](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/6769)
* Added per-session MFA support to Database Access.
  [#8270](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/8270)
* Added support for profile specific `kubeconfig`.
  [#7840](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/7840)

### Fixes

* Fixed issues with web applications that utilized
  [EventSource](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventSource)
  with Application Access.
  [#8359](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/8359)
* Fixed issue were interactive sessions would always return exit code 0.
  [#8081](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/8081)
* Fixed issue where JWT signer was omitted from bootstrap logic.
  [#8119](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/8119)

### Breaking Changes

#### CentOS 6

CentOS 6 support will be deprecated in Teleport 8 and removed in Teleport 9.

Teleport 8 will continue to receive security patches for about 9 months after
which it will be EOL. Users are encouraged to upgrade to CentOS 7 in that time
frame.

#### Updated  dependencies

New run time dependencies have been added to Teleport 8 due to the inclusion of
Rust in the build chain. Teleport 8 requires `libgcc_s.so` and `libm.so` be
installed on systems running Teleport.

Users of [distroless](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/distroless)
container images are encouraged to use the
[gcr.io/distroless/cc-debian11](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/distroless/blob/main/examples/rust/Dockerfile)
image to run Teleport.

```
FROM gcr.io/distroless/cc-debian11
```

Alpine users are recommended to install the `libgcc` package in addition to any
glibc compatibility layer they have already been using.

```
apk --update --no-cache add libgcc
```

#### Database Access Certificates

With the `GODEBUG=x509ignoreCN=0` flag removed in Go 1.17, Database Access users
will no longer be able to connect to databases that include their hostname in
the `CommonName` field of the presented certificate. Users are recommended to
update their database certificates to include hostname in the
`Subject Alternative Name` extension instead.

Subscribe to Github issue
[#7636](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/7636) which will add
ability to control level of TLS verification as a workaround.

#### Role Changes

New clusters will no longer have the default `admin` role, it has been replaced
with 3 smaller scoped roles: `access`, `auditor`, and `editor`.

### Security fixes

As part of a routine security audit of Teleport, several security vulnerabilities
and miscellaneous issues were discovered. Below are the issues found, their
impact, and the components of Teleport they affect.

#### Server Access

An attacker with privileged network position could forge SSH host certificates
that Teleport would incorrectly validate in specific code paths. The specific
paths of concern are:

* Using `tsh` with an identity file (commonly used for service accounts). This
  could lead to potentially leaking of sensitive commands the service account
  runs or in the case of proxy recording mode, the attacker could also gain
  control of the SSH agent being used.

* Teleport agents could incorrectly connect to an attacker controlled cluster.
  Note, this would not give the attacker access or control of resources (like
  SSH, Kubernetes, Applications, or Database servers) because Teleport agents
  will still reject all connections without a valid x509 or SSH user
  certificate.

#### Database Access

When connecting to a Postgres database, an attacker could craft a database name
or a username in a way that would have allowed them control over the resulting
connection string.

An attacker could have probed connections to other reachable database servers
and alter connection parameters such as disable TLS or connect to a database
authenticated by a password.

#### All

During an internal security exercise our engineers have discovered a
vulnerability in Teleport build infrastructure that could have been potentially
used to alter build artifacts. We have found no evidence of any exploitation. In
an effort to be open and transparent with our customers, we encourage all
customers to upgrade to the latest patch release.

#### Actions

For all users, we recommend upgrading all components of their Teleport cluster.
If upgrading all components is not possible, we recommend upgrading `tsh` and
Teleport agents (including trusted cluster proxies) that use reverse tunnels.

Upgrades should follow the normal Teleport upgrade procedure:
https://goteleport.com/teleport/docs/admin-guide/#upgrading-teleport.

#### Kubernetes Access

Kubernetes Access will no longer automatically register a cluster named after the Teleport cluster if the proxy is running within a Kubernetes cluster. Users wishing to retain this functionality now have to explicitly set `kube_cluster_name`. [#6786](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/6786)

#### `tsh`

`tsh login` has been updated to no longer change the current Kubernetes context. While `tsh login` will write credentials to `kubeconfig` it will only update your context if `tsh login --kube-cluster` or `tsh kube login <kubeCluster>` is used. [#6045](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/6045)

## 6.2.0

Teleport 6.2 contains new features, improvements, and bug fixes.

**Note:** the DynamoDB indexing change described below may cause rate-limiting
errors from AWS APIs and is slow on large deployments (1000+ existing audit
events). The next patch release, v6.2.1, will improve the migration performance.
If you run a large DynamoDB-based cluster, we advise you to wait for v6.2.1
before upgrading.

### New Features

* Changed DynamoDB indexing strategy for events. [RFD 24](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/blob/master/rfd/0024-dynamo-event-overflow.md) [#6583](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/6583)

### Fixes

* Fixed multiple per-session MFA issues. [#6542](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/6542) [#6567](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/6567) [#6625](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/6625) [#6779](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/6779) [#6948](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/6948)

* Fixed an issue with PAM variable interpolation. [#6558](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/6558)

### Breaking Changes

#### Agent Forwarding

Teleport 6.2 brings a potentially backward incompatible change with `tsh` agent forwarding.

Prior to Teleport 6.2, `tsh ssh -A` would create an in-memory SSH agent from your `~/.tsh` directory and forward that agent to the target host.

Starting in Teleport 6.2 `tsh ssh -A` by default now forwards your system SSH agent (available at `$SSH_AUTH_SOCK`). Users wishing to retain the prior behavior can use `tsh ssh -o "ForwardAgent local"`.

For more details see [RFD 22](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/blob/master/rfd/0022-ssh-agent-forwarding.md) and implementation in [#6525](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/6525).

#### DynamoDB Indexing Change

DynamoDB users should note that the events backend indexing strategy has
changed and a data migration will be triggered after upgrade. For optimal
performance perform this migration with only one auth server online. It may
take some time and progress will be periodically written to the auth server
log. During this migration, only events that have been migrated will appear in
the Web UI. After completion, all events will be available.

For more details see [RFD 24](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/blob/master/rfd/0024-dynamo-event-overflow.md) and implementation in [#6583](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/6583).

## 6.1.0

Teleport 6.1 contains multiple new features, improvements, and bug fixes.

### New Features

#### U2F for Kubernetes and SSH sessions

Added support for U2F authentication on every SSH and Kubernetes "connection" (a single `tsh ssh` or `kubectl` call). This is an advanced security feature that protects users against compromises of their on-disk Teleport certificates. Per-session MFA can be enforced cluster-wide or only for some specific roles.

For more details see [Per-Session MFA](https://goteleport.com/docs/access-controls/guides/per-session-mfa) documentation or [RFD 14](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/blob/master/rfd/0014-session-2FA.md) and [RFD 15](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/blob/master/rfd/0015-2fa-management.md) for technical details.

## 6.0.0

Teleport 6.0 is a major release with new features, functionality, and bug fixes.

We have implemented [Database Access](https://goteleport.com/teleport/docs/database-access/),
open sourced role-based access control (RBAC), and added official API and a Go client library.

Users can review the [6.0 milestone](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/milestone/33?closed=1) on Github for more details.

### New Features

#### Database Access

Review the Database Access design in [RFD #11](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/blob/master/rfd/0011-database-access.md).

With Database Access users can connect to PostgreSQL and MySQL databases using short-lived certificates, configure SSO authentication and role-based access controls for databases, and capture SQL query activity in the audit log.

##### Getting Started

Configure Database Access following the [Getting Started](https://goteleport.com/teleport/docs/database-access/getting-started/) guide.

##### Guides

* [AWS RDS/Aurora PostgreSQL](https://goteleport.com/teleport/docs/database-access/guides/postgres-aws/)
* [AWS RDS/Aurora MySQL](https://goteleport.com/teleport/docs/database-access/guides/mysql-aws/)
* [Self-hosted PostgreSQL](https://goteleport.com/teleport/docs/database-access/guides/postgres-self-hosted/)

##### Resources

To learn more about configuring role-based access control for Database Access, check out [RBAC](https://goteleport.com/teleport/docs/database-access/rbac/) section.

[Architecture](https://goteleport.com/teleport/docs/database-access/architecture/) provides a more in-depth look at Database Access internals such as networking and security.

See [Reference](https://goteleport.com/teleport/docs/database-access/reference/) for an overview of Database Access related configuration and CLI commands.

Finally, check out [Frequently Asked Questions](docs/pages/database-access/faq.mdx).

#### OSS RBAC

Open source RBAC support was introduced in [RFD #7](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/blob/master/rfd/0007-rbac-oss.md).

RBAC support gives OSS administrators more granular access controls to servers and other resources with a cluster (like session recording access). An example of an RBAC policy could be: "admins can do anything, developers must never touch production servers and interns can only SSH into staging servers as guests"

In addition, some Access Workflow Plugins will now become available to open source users.

* Access Workflows Golang SDK and API
* Slack
* Gitlab
* Mattermost
* JIRA Plugin
* PagerDuty Plugin

#### Client libraries and API

API and Client Libraries support was introduced in [RFD #10](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/blob/master/rfd/0010-api.md).

The new API and client library reduces the dependencies needed to use the Teleport API as well as making it easier to use. An example of using the new API is below.

```go
// Create a client connected to the Auth server with an exported identity file.
clt, err := client.NewClient(client.Config{
  Addrs: []string{"auth.example.com:3025"},
  Credentials: []client.Credentials{
    client.LoadIdentityFile("identity.pem"),
  },
})
if err != nil {
  log.Fatalf("Failed to create client: %v.", err)
}
defer clt.Close()

// Create a Access Request.
accessRequest, err := types.NewAccessRequest(uuid.New(), "access-admin", "admin")
if err != nil {
  log.Fatalf("Failed to build access request: %v.", err)
}
if err = clt.CreateAccessRequest(ctx, accessRequest); err != nil {
  log.Fatalf("Failed to create access request: %v.", err)
}
```

### Improvements

* Added `utmp`/`wtmp` support for SSH in [#5491](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/5491).
* Added the ability to set a Kubernetes specific public address in [#5611](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/5611).
* Added Proxy Protocol support to Kubernetes Access in [#5299](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/5299).
* Added ACME ([Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/)) support to make getting and using TLS certificates easier. [#5177](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/5177).
* Added the ability to manage local users to the Web UI in [#2945](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/2945).
* Added the ability to preserve timestamps when using `tsh scp` in [#2889](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/2889).

### Fixes

* Fixed authentication failure when logging in via CLI with Access Workflows after removing `.tsh` directory in [#5323](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/5323).
* Fixed `tsh login` failure when `--proxy` differs from actual proxy public address in [#5380](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/5380).
* Fixed session playback issues in [#2945](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/2945).
* Fixed several UX issues in [#5559](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/5559), [#5568](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/5568), [#4965](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/4965), and [#5057](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/5057).

### Upgrade Notes

Please follow our [standard upgrade procedure](https://goteleport.com/teleport/docs/admin-guide/#upgrading-teleport) to upgrade your cluster.

Note, for clusters using GitHub SSO and Trusted Clusters, when upgrading SSO users will lose connectivity to leaf clusters. Local users will not be affected.

To restore connectivity to leaf clusters for SSO users, leaf admins should update the `trusted_cluster` role mapping resource like below.

```yaml
kind: trusted_cluster
version: v2
metadata:
   name: "zztop-oss"
spec:
   enabled: true
   token: "bar"
   web_proxy_addr: 172.10.1.1:3080
   tunnel_addr: 172.10.1.1:3024
   role_map:
   - remote: "admin"
     local: ['admin']
   - remote: "^(github-.*)$"
     local: ['admin']
```

## 5.1.0

This release of Teleport adds a new feature.

* Support for creating and assuming Access Workflow requests from within the Web UI (first step toward full Workflow UI support: [#4937](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/4937)).

## 5.0.2

This release of Teleport contains a security fix.

* Patch a SAML authentication bypass (see https://github.com/russellhaering/gosaml2/security/advisories/GHSA-xhqq-x44f-9fgg): [#5119](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/5119).

Any Enterprise SSO users using Okta, Active Directory, OneLogin or custom SAML connectors should upgrade their auth servers to version 5.0.2 and restart Teleport. If you are unable to upgrade immediately, we suggest disabling SAML connectors for all clusters until the updates can be applied.


## 5.0.1

This release of Teleport contains multiple bug fixes.

* Always set expiry times on server resource in heartbeats [#5008](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/5008)
* Fixes streaming k8s responses (`kubectl logs -f`, `kubectl run -it`, etc) [#5009](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/5009)
* Multiple fixes for the k8s forwarder [#5038](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/5038)

## 5.0.0

Teleport 5.0 is a major release with new features, functionality, and bug fixes. Users can review [5.0 closed issues](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/milestone/39?closed=1) on Github for details of all items.

#### New Features

Teleport 5.0 introduces two distinct features: Teleport Application Access and significant Kubernetes Access improvements - multi-cluster support.

##### Teleport Application Access

Teleport can now be used to provide secure access to web applications. This new feature was built with the express intention of securing internal apps which might have once lived on a VPN or had a simple authorization and authentication mechanism with little to no audit trail. Application Access works with everything from dashboards to single page Javascript applications (SPA).

Application Access uses mutually authenticated reverse tunnels to establish a secure connection with the Teleport unified Access Plane which can then becomes the single ingress point for all traffic to an internal application.

Adding an application follows the same UX as adding SSH servers or Kubernetes clusters, starting with creating a static or dynamic invite token.

```bash
$ tctl tokens add --type=app
```

Then simply start Teleport with a few new flags.

```sh
$ teleport start --roles=app --token=xyz --auth-server=proxy.example.com:3080 \
    --app-name="example-app" \
    --app-uri="http://localhost:8080"
```

This command will start an app server that proxies the application "example-app" running at `http://localhost:8080` at the public address `https://example-app.example.com`.

Applications can also be configured using the new `app_service` section in `teleport.yaml`.

```yaml
app_service:
   # Teleport Application Access is enabled.
   enabled: yes
   # We've added a default sample app that will check
   # that Teleport Application Access is working
   # and output JWT tokens.
   # https://dumper.teleport.example.com:3080/
   debug_app: true
   apps:
   # Application Access can be used to proxy any HTTP endpoint.
   # Note: Name can't include any spaces and should be DNS-compatible A-Za-z0-9-._
   - name: "internal-dashboard"
     uri: "http://10.0.1.27:8000"
     # By default Teleport will make this application
     # available on a sub-domain of your Teleport proxy's hostname
     # internal-dashboard.teleport.example.com
     # - thus the importance of setting up wilcard DNS.
     # If you want, it's possible to set up a custom public url.
     # DNS records should point to the proxy server.
     # internal-dashboard.teleport.example.com
     # Example Public URL for the internal-dashboard app.
     # public_addr: "internal-dashboard.acme.com"
     # Optional labels
     # Labels can be combined with RBAC rules to provide access.
     labels:
       customer: "acme"
       env: "production"
     # Optional dynamic labels
     commands:
     - name: "os"
       command: ["/usr/bin/uname"]
       period: "5s"
     # A proxy can support multiple applications. Application Access
     # can also be deployed with a Teleport node.
     - name: "arris"
       uri: "http://localhost:3001"
       public_addr: "arris.example.com"
```

Application access requires two additional changes. DNS must be updated to point the application domain to the proxy and the proxy must be loaded with a TLS certificate for the domain. Wildcard DNS and TLS certificates can be used to simplify deployment.

```yaml
# When adding the app_service certificates are required to provide a TLS
# connection. The certificates are managed by the proxy_service
proxy_service:
  # We've extended support for https certs. Teleport can now load multiple
  # TLS certificates. In the below example we've obtained a wildcard cert
  # that'll be used for proxying the applications.
  # The correct certificate is selected based on the hostname in the HTTPS
  # request using SNI.
  https_keypairs:
  - key_file: /etc/letsencrypt/live/teleport.example.com/privkey.pem
    cert_file: /etc/letsencrypt/live/teleport.example.com/fullchain.pem
  - key_file: /etc/letsencrypt/live/*.teleport.example.com/privkey.pem
    cert_file: /etc/letsencrypt/live/*.teleport.example.com/fullchain.pem
```

You can learn more at [https://goteleport.com/teleport/docs/application-access/](https://goteleport.com/teleport/docs/application-access/)

##### Teleport Kubernetes Access

Teleport 5.0 also introduces two highly requested features for Kubernetes.

* The ability to connect multiple Kubernetes Clusters to the Teleport Access Plane, greatly reducing operational complexity.
* Complete Kubernetes audit log capture [#4526](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/4526), going beyond the existing `kubectl exec` capture.

For a full overview please review the [Kubernetes RFD](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/blob/master/rfd/0005-kubernetes-service.md).

To support these changes, we've introduced a new service. This moves Teleport Kubernetes configuration from the `proxy_service` into its own dedicated `kubernetes_service` section.

When adding the new Kubernetes service, a new type of join token is required.

```bash
tctl tokens add --type=kube
```

Example configuration for the new `kubernetes_service`:

```yaml
# ...
kubernetes_service:
   enabled: yes
   listen_addr: 0.0.0.0:3027
   kubeconfig_file: /secrets/kubeconfig
```

Note: a Kubernetes port still needs to be configured in the `proxy_service` via `kube_listen_addr`.

#### New "tsh kube" commands

`tsh kube` commands are used to query registered clusters and switch `kubeconfig` context:

```sh
$ tsh login --proxy=proxy.example.com --user=awly

# list all registered clusters
$ tsh kube ls
Cluster Name       Status
-------------      ------
a.k8s.example.com  online
b.k8s.example.com  online
c.k8s.example.com  online

# on login, kubeconfig is pointed at the first cluster (alphabetically)
$ kubectl config current-context
proxy.example.com-a.k8s.example.com

# but all clusters are populated as contexts
$ kubectl config get-contexts
CURRENT   NAME                     CLUSTER             AUTHINFO
*         proxy.example.com-a.k8s.example.com   proxy.example.com   proxy.example.com-a.k8s.example.com
          proxy.example.com-b.k8s.example.com   proxy.example.com   proxy.example.com-b.k8s.example.com
          proxy.example.com-c.k8s.example.com   proxy.example.com   proxy.example.com-c.k8s.example.com

# switch between different clusters:
$ tsh kube login c.k8s.example.com

# the traditional way is also supported:
$ kubectl config use-context proxy.example.com-c.k8s.example.com

# check current cluster
$ kubectl config current-context
proxy.example.com-c.k8s.example.com
```

Other Kubernetes changes:

* Support k8s clusters behind firewall/NAT using a single Teleport cluster [#3667](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/3667)
* Support multiple k8s clusters with a single Teleport proxy instance [#3952](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/3952)

##### Additional User and Token Resource

We've added two new RBAC resources; these provide the ability to limit token creation and to list and modify Teleport users:

```yaml
- resources: [user]
  verbs: [list,create,read,update,delete]
- resources: [token]
  verbs: [list,create,read,update,delete]
```

Learn more about [Teleport's RBAC Resources](https://goteleport.com/teleport/docs/enterprise/ssh-rbac/)

##### Cluster Labels

Teleport 5.0 also adds the ability to set labels on Trusted Clusters. The labels are set when creating a trusted cluster invite token. This lets teams use the same RBAC controls used on nodes to approve or deny access to clusters. This can be especially useful for MSPs that connect hundreds of customers' clusters - when combined with Access Workflows, cluster access can easily be delegated. Learn more by reviewing our [Truster Cluster Setup & RBAC Docs](https://goteleport.com/teleport/docs/trustedclusters/#dynamic-join-tokens)

Creating a trusted cluster join token for a production environment:

```bash
$ tctl tokens add --type=trusted_cluster --labels=env=prod
```

```yaml
kind: role
#...
  deny:
    # cluster labels control what clusters user can connect to. The wildcard ('*')
    # means any cluster. By default, deny rules are empty to preserve backwards
    # compatibility
    cluster_labels:
      'env': 'prod'
```

##### Teleport UI Updates

Teleport 5.0 also iterates on the UI Refresh from 4.3. We've moved the cluster list into our sidebar and have added an Application launcher. For customers moving from 4.4 to 5.0, you'll notice that we have moved session recordings back to their own dedicated section.

Other updates:

* We now provide local user management via `https://[cluster-url]/web/users`, providing the ability to easily edit, reset and delete local users.
* Teleport Node & App Install scripts. This is currently an Enterprise-only feature that provides customers with an easy 'auto-magic' installer script. Enterprise customers can enable this feature by modifying the 'token' resource. See note above.
* We've added a Waiting Room for customers using Access Workflows. [Docs](./docs/pages/enterprise/workflow/index.mdx)

##### Signed RPM and Releases

Starting with Teleport 5.0, we now provide an RPM repo for stable releases of Teleport. We've also started signing our RPMs to provide assurance that you're always using an official build of Teleport.

See https://rpm.releases.teleport.dev/ for more details.

#### Improvements

* Added `--format=json` playback option for `tsh play`. For example `tsh play --format=json ~/play/0c0b81ed-91a9-4a2a-8d7c-7495891a6ca0.tar | jq '.event` can be used to show all events within an a local archive. [#4578](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/4578)
* Added support for continuous backups and auto scaling for DynamoDB. [#4780](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/4780)
* Added a Linux ARM64/ARMv8 (64-bit) Release. [#3383](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/3383)
* Added `https_keypairs` field which replaces `https_key_file` and `https_cert_file`. This allows administrators to load multiple HTTPS certs for Teleport Application Access. Teleport 5.0 is backwards compatible with the old format, but we recommend updating your configuration to use `https_keypairs`.

Enterprise Only:

* `tctl` can load credentials from `~/.tsh` [#4678](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/4678)
* Teams can require a user submitted reason when using Access Workflows [#4573](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/4573#issuecomment-720777443)

#### Fixes

* Updated `tctl` to always format resources as lists in JSON/YAML. [#4281](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/4281)
* Updated `tsh status` to now print Kubernetes status. [#4348](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/4348)
* Fixed intermittent issues with `loginuid.so`. [#3245](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/3245)
* Reduced `access denied to Proxy` log spam. [#2920](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/2920)
* Various AMI fixes: paths are now consistent with other Teleport packages and configuration files will not be overwritten on reboot.

#### Documentation

We've added an [API Reference](https://goteleport.com/docs/api-reference/) to simply developing applications against Teleport.

#### Upgrade Notes

Please follow our [standard upgrade procedure](https://goteleport.com/teleport/docs/admin-guide/#upgrading-teleport).

* Optional: Consider updating `https_key_file` & `https_cert_file` to our new `https_keypairs:` format.
* Optional: Consider migrating Kubernetes Access from `proxy_service` to `kubernetes_service` after the upgrade.

### 4.4.6

This release of teleport contains a security fix and a bug fix.

* Patch a SAML authentication bypass (see https://github.com/russellhaering/gosaml2/security/advisories/GHSA-xhqq-x44f-9fgg): [#5120](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/5120).

Any Enterprise SSO users using Okta, Active Directory, OneLogin or custom SAML connectors should upgrade their auth servers to version 4.4.6 and restart Teleport. If you are unable to upgrade immediately, we suggest disabling SAML connectors for all clusters until the updates can be applied.

* Fix an issue where `tsh login` would fail with an `AccessDenied` error if
the user was perviously logged into a leaf cluster. [#5105](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/5105)

### 4.4.5

This release of Teleport contains a bug fix.

* Fixed an issue where a slow or unresponsive Teleport auth service could hang client connections in async recording mode. [#4696](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/4696)

### 4.4.4

This release of Teleport adds enhancements to the Access Workflows API.

* Support for creating limited roles that trigger access requests
on login, allowing users to be configured such that no nodes can
be accessed without externally granted roles.

* Teleport UI support for automatically generating access requests and
assuming new roles upon approval (access requests were previously
only available in `tsh`).

* New `claims_to_roles` mapping that can use claims from external
identity providers to determine which roles a user can request.

* Various minor API improvements to help make requests easier to
manage and audit, including support for human-readable
request/approve/deny reasons and structured annotations.

### 4.4.2

This release of Teleport adds support for a new build architecture.

* Added automatic arm64 builds of Teleport to the download portal.

### 4.4.1

This release of Teleport contains a bug fix.

* Fixed an issue where defining multiple logging configurations would cause Teleport to crash. [#4598](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/4598)

### 4.4.0

This is a major Teleport release with a focus on new features, functionality, and bug fixes. It’s a substantial release and users can review [4.4 closed issues](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/milestone/40?closed=1) on Github for details of all items.

#### New Features

##### Concurrent Session Control

This addition to Teleport helps customers obtain AC-10 control. We now provide two new optional configuration values: `max_connections` and `max_sessions`.

###### `max_connections`

This value is the total number of concurrent sessions within a cluster to nodes running Teleport. This value is applied at a per user level. If you set `max_connections` to `1`, a `tsh` user would only be able to `tsh ssh` into one node at a time.

###### `max_sessions` per connection

This value limits the total number of session channels which can be established across a single SSH connection (typically used for interactive terminals or remote exec operations). This is for cases where nodes have Teleport set up, but a user is using OpenSSH to connect to them. It is essentially equivalent to the `MaxSessions` configuration value accepted by `sshd`.

```yaml
spec:
  options:
    # Optional: Required to be set for AC-10 Compliance
    max_connections: 2
    # Optional: To match OpenSSH behavior set to 10
    max_sessions: 10
```

###### `session_control_timeout`

A new `session_control_timeout` configuration value has been added to the `auth_service` configuration block of the Teleport config file. It's unlikely that you'll need to modify this.

```yaml
auth_service:
  session_control_timeout: 2m # default
# ...
```

#### Session Streaming Improvements

Teleport 4.4 includes a complete refactoring of our event system. This resolved a few customer bug reports such as [#3800: Events overwritten in DynamoDB](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/3800) and [#3182: Teleport consuming all disk space with multipart uploads](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/3182).

Along with foundational improvements, 4.4 includes two new experimental `session_recording` options: `node-sync` and `proxy-sync`.
NOTE: These experimental modes require all Teleport auth servers, proxy servers and nodes to be running Teleport 4.4.

```yaml
# This section configures the 'auth service':
auth_service:
    # Optional setting for configuring session recording. Possible values are:
    #     "node"  : sessions will be recorded on the node level (the default)
    #     "proxy" : recording on the proxy level, see "recording proxy mode" section.
    #     "off"   : session recording is turned off
    #
    #     EXPERIMENTAL *-sync modes: proxy and node send logs directly to S3 or other
    #     storage without storing the records on disk at all. This mode will kill a
    #     connection if network connectivity is lost.
    #     NOTE: These experimental modes require all Teleport auth servers, proxy servers and
    #     nodes to be running Teleport 4.4.
    #
    #     "node-sync" : sessions recording will be streamed from node -> auth -> storage
    #     "proxy-sync : sessions recording will be streamed from proxy -> auth -> storage
    #
    session_recording: "node-sync"
```

#### Improvements

## 4.3.0

This is a major Teleport release with a focus on new features, functionality, and bug fixes. It’s a substantial release and users can review [4.3 closed issues](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/milestone/37?closed=1) on Github for details of all items.

#### New Features

##### Web UI

Teleport 4.3 includes a completely redesigned Web UI. The new Web UI expands the management functionality of a Teleport cluster and the user experience of using Teleport to make it easier and simpler to use. Teleport's new terminal provides a quick jumping-off point to access nodes and nodes on other clusters via the web.

Teleport's Web UI now exposes Teleport’s Audit log, letting auditors and administrators view Teleport access events, SSH events, recording session, and enhanced session recording all in one view.

##### Teleport Plugins

Teleport 4.3 introduces four new plugins that work out of the box with [Approval Workflow](./docs/pages/enterprise/workflow/index.mdx). These plugins allow you to automatically support role escalation with commonly used third party services. The built-in plugins are listed below.

*   [PagerDuty](./docs/pages/enterprise/workflow/ssh-approval-pagerduty.mdx)

*   [Documented Teleport Plugins](./docs/pages/enterprise/workflow/index.mdx)
*   [Documented Kubernetes Role Mapping](https://gravitational.com/teleport/docs/kubernetes_ssh/#kubernetes-groups-and-users)

#### Upgrade Notes

Always follow the [recommended upgrade procedure](https://gravitational.com/teleport/docs/admin-guide/#upgrading-teleport?utm_source=github&utm_medium=changelog&utm_campaign=4_3) to upgrade to this version.

##### New Signing Algorithm

If you’re upgrading an existing version of Teleport, you may want to consider rotating CA to SHA-256 or SHA-512 for RSA SSH certificate signatures. The previous default was SHA-1, which is now considered to be weak against brute-force attacks. SHA-1 certificate signatures are also [no longer accepted](https://www.openssh.com/releasenotes.html) by OpenSSH versions 8.2 and above. All new Teleport clusters will default to SHA-512 based signatures. To upgrade an existing cluster, set the following in your `teleport.yaml`:

```
teleport:
    ca_signature_algo: "rsa-sha2-512"
```

Rotate the cluster CA, following [these docs](https://gravitational.com/teleport/docs/admin-guide/#certificate-rotation?utm_source=github&utm_medium=changelog&utm_campaign=4_3).

##### Web UI

Due to the number of changes included in the redesigned Web UI, some URLs and functionality have shifted. Refer to the following ticket for more details. [#3580](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/3580)

##### RBAC for Audit Log and Recorded Sessions

Teleport 4.3 has made the audit log accessible via the Web UI. Enterprise customers
can limit access by changing the options on the new `event` resource.

```yaml
# list and read audit log, including audit events and recorded sessions
- resources: [event]
  verbs: [list, read]
```

##### Kubernetes Permissions

The minimum set of Kubernetes permissions that need to be granted to Teleport proxies has been updated. If you use the Kubernetes integration, please make sure that the ClusterRole used by the proxy has [sufficient permissions](https://gravitational.com/teleport/docs/kubernetes_ssh#impersonation).

##### Path prefix for etcd

The [etcd backend](https://gravitational.com/teleport/docs/admin-guide/#using-etcd) now correctly uses the “prefix” config value when storing data. Upgrading from 4.2 to 4.3 will migrate the data as needed at startup. Make sure you follow our Teleport [upgrade guidance](https://gravitational.com/teleport/docs/admin-guide/#upgrading-teleport).

**Note: If you use an etcd backend with a non-default prefix and need to downgrade from 4.3 to 4.2, you should [backup Teleport data and restore it](https://gravitational.com/teleport/docs/admin-guide/#backing-up-teleport) into the downgraded cluster.**

## 4.2.12

This release of Teleport contains a security fix.

* Mitigated [CVE-2020-15216](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-15216) by updating github.com/russellhaering/goxmldsig.

### Details
A vulnerability was discovered in the `github.com/russellhaering/goxmldsig` library which is used by Teleport to validate the
signatures of XML files used to configure SAML 2.0 connectors. With a carefully crafted XML file, an attacker can completely
bypass XML signature validation and pass off an altered file as a signed one.

### Actions
The `goxmldsig` library has been updated upstream and Teleport 4.2.12 includes the fix. Any Enterprise SSO users using Okta,
Active Directory, OneLogin or custom SAML connectors should upgrade their auth servers to version 4.2.12 and restart Teleport.

If you are unable to upgrade immediately, we suggest deleting SAML connectors for all clusters until the updates can be applied.

## 4.2.11

This release of Teleport contains multiple bug fixes.

* Fixed an issue that prevented upload of session archives to NFS volumes. [#3780](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/3780)
* Fixed an issue with port forwarding that prevented TCP connections from being closed correctly. [#3801](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/3801)
* Fixed an issue in `tsh` that would cause connections to the Auth Server to fail on large clusters. [#3872](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/3872)
* Fixed an issue that prevented the use of Write-Only roles with S3 and GCS. [#3810](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/3810)

## 4.2.10

This release of Teleport contains multiple bug fixes.

* Fixed an issue that caused Teleport environment variables not to be available in PAM modules. [#3725](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/3725)

* Fixed issue where `^C` would not terminate `tsh`. [#3456](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/3456)
* Fixed an issue where enhanced session recording could cause Teleport to panic. [#3506](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/3506)

## 4.2.7

As part of a routine security audit of Teleport, a security vulnerability was discovered that affects all recent releases of Teleport. We strongly suggest upgrading to the latest patched release to mitigate this vulnerability.

### Details

Due to a flaw in how the Teleport Web UI handled host certificate validation, host certificate validation was disabled for clusters where connections were terminated at the node. This means that an attacker could impersonate a Teleport node without detection when connecting through the Web UI.

Clusters where sessions were terminated at the proxy (recording proxy mode) are not affected.

Command line programs like `tsh` (or `ssh`) are not affected by this vulnerability.

### Actions

To mitigate this issue, upgrade and restart all Teleport proxy processes.

## 4.1.11

This release of Teleport contains a security fix.

* Mitigated [CVE-2020-15216](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-15216) by updating github.com/russellhaering/goxmldsig.

### Details
A vulnerability was discovered in the `github.com/russellhaering/goxmldsig` library which is used by Teleport to validate the
signatures of XML files used to configure SAML 2.0 connectors. With a carefully crafted XML file, an attacker can completely
bypass XML signature validation and pass off an altered file as a signed one.

### Actions
The `goxmldsig` library has been updated upstream and Teleport 4.1.11 includes the fix. Any Enterprise SSO users using Okta,
Active Directory, OneLogin or custom SAML connectors should upgrade their auth servers to version 4.1.11 and restart Teleport.

If you are unable to upgrade immediately, we suggest deleting SAML connectors for all clusters until the updates can be applied.

## 4.1.10

As part of a routine security audit of Teleport, a security vulnerability was discovered that affects all recent releases of Teleport. We strongly suggest upgrading to the latest patched release to mitigate this vulnerability.

### Details

Due to a flaw in how the Teleport Web UI handled host certificate validation, host certificate validation was disabled for clusters where connections were terminated at the node. This means that an attacker could impersonate a Teleport node without detection when connecting through the Web UI.

Clusters where sessions were terminated at the proxy (recording proxy mode) are not affected.

Command line programs like `tsh` (or `ssh`) are not affected by this vulnerability.

### Actions

To mitigate this issue, upgrade and restart all Teleport proxy processes.

## 4.1.9

## 4.0.0

This is a major Teleport release which introduces support for Teleport Internet of Things (IoT). In addition to this new feature this release includes usability, performance, and bug fixes listed below.

### New Features

#### Teleport for IoT

With Teleport 4.0, nodes gain the ability to use reverse tunnels to dial back to a Teleport cluster to bypass firewall restrictions. This allows connections even to nodes that a cluster does not have direct network access to. Customers that have been using Trusted Clusters to achieve this can now utilize a unified interface to access all nodes within their infrastructure.

#### FedRamp Compliance

With this release of Teleport, we have built out the foundation to help Teleport Enterprise customers build and meet the requirements in a FedRAMP System Security Plan (SSP). This includes a FIPS 140-2 friendly build of Teleport Enterprise as well as a variety of improvements to aid in complying with security controls even in FedRAMP High environments.

### Improvements

* Teleport now support 10,000 remote connections to a single Teleport cluster. [Using our recommend hardware setup.](./docs/pages/setup/operations/scaling.mdx#hardware-recommendations)
* Added ability to delete node using `tctl rm`. [#2685](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/2685)
* Output of `tsh ls` is now sorted by node name. [#2534](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/2534)

### Bug Fixes

* Switched to `xdg-open` to open a browser window on Linux. [#2536](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/2536)
* Increased SSO callback timeout to 180 seconds. [#2533](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/2533)
* Set permissions on TTY similar to OpenSSH. [#2508](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/2508)

The lists of improvements and bug fixes above mention only the significant changes, please take a look at the complete list on Github for more.

### Upgrading

Teleport 4.0 is backwards compatible with Teleport 3.2 and later. [Follow the recommended upgrade procedure to upgrade to this version.](https://gravitational.com/teleport/docs/admin-guide/#upgrading-teleport)

Note that due to substantial changes between Teleport 3.2 and 4.0, we recommend creating a backup of the backend datastore (DynamoDB, etcd, or dir) before upgrading a cluster to Teleport 4.0 to allow downgrades.

#### Notes on compatibility

Teleport has always validated host certificates when a client connects to a server, however prior to Teleport 4.0, Teleport did not validate the host the user requests a connection to is in the list of principals on the certificate. To ensure a seamless upgrade, make sure the hosts you connect to have the appropriate address set in `public_addr` in `teleport.yaml` before upgrading.

Teleport 3.0.3 contains a security fix. We strongly encourage anyone running Teleport 3.0.2 to upgrade.

#### Bugfixes

* Due to the flaw in internal RBAC verification logic, a compromised node, trusted cluster or authenticated non-privileged user can craft special request to Teleport's internal auth server API to gain access to the private key material of the cluster's internal certificate authorities and elevate their privileges to gain full administrative access to the Teleport cluster. This vulnerability only affects authenticated clients, there is no known way to exploit this vulnerability outside the cluster for unauthenticated clients.

## 3.0.2

Teleport 3.0.2 contains a security fix. We strongly encourage anyone running Teleport 3.0.1 to upgrade.

* Upgraded Go to 1.11.4 to mitigate CVE-2018-16875: [CPU denial of service in chain validation](https://golang.org/issue/29233) Go. For customers using the RHEL5.x compatible release of Teleport, we've backported this fix to Go 1.9.7, before releasing RHEL 5.x compatible binaries.

## 3.0.1

This release of Teleport contains the following bug fix:

* Fix regression that marked ADFS claims as invalid. [#2293](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/2293)

## 3.0

This is a major Teleport release which introduces support for Kubernetes
clusters. In addition to this new feature this release includes several
usability and performance improvements listed below.

#### Kubernetes Support

* `tsh login` can retreive and install certificates for both Kubernetes and SSH
  at the same time.
* Full audit log support for `kubectl` commands, including recording of the sessions
  if `kubectl exec` command was interactive.
* Unified (AKA "single pane of glass") RBAC for both SSH and Kubernetes permissions.

For more information about Kubernetes support, take a look at
the [Kubernetes and SSH Integration Guide](https://gravitational.com/teleport/docs/kubernetes_ssh/)

  setting which allows them to be hosted behind NAT/Load Balancers. [#1793](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/1793)
* We have documented the previously undocumented monitoring endpoints [#2103](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/2103)
* The `etcd` back-end has been updated to implement 3.3+ protocol. See the upgrading notes below.
* Listing nodes via `tsh ls` or the web UI no longer shows nodes that the currently logged in user has no access to. [#1954](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/1954)
* It is now possible to build `tsh` client on Windows. Note: only `tsh login` command is implemented. [#1996](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/1996).
* `-i` flag to `tsh login` is now guarantees to be non-interactive. [#2221](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/2221)

#### Bugfixes

* Removed the bogus error message "access denied to perform action create on user" [#2132](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/2132)
* `scp` implementation in "recording proxy" mode did not work correctly. [#2176](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/2176)
* Removed the limit of 8 trusted clusters with SSO. [#2192](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/2192)
* `tsh ls` now works correctly when executed on a remote/trusted cluster [#2204](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/milestone/24?closed=1)

## 2.6.0

This release of Teleport brings new features, significant performance and
usability improvements as well usual bugfixes.

During this release cycle, the Teleport source code has been audited for
security vulnerabilities by Cure53 and this release (2.6.0) contains patches
for the discovered problems.

#### New Features

* Support for DynamoDB for storing the audit log events. [#1755](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/1755)
* Support for Amazon S3 for storing the recorded SSH sessions. [#1755](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/1755)
* Support for rotating certificate authorities (CA rotation). [#1899] (https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/1899)
* Integration with Linux PAM (pluggable authentication modules) subsystem. [#742](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/742) and [#1766](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/1766)
* The new CLI command `tsh status` shows users which Teleport clusters they are authenticated with. [#1628](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/1628)

Additionally, Teleport 2.6.0 has been submitted to the AWS marketplace. Soon
AWS users will be able to create properly configured, secure and highly
available Teleport clusters with ease.

#### Configuration Changes

* Role templates (depreciated in Teleport 2.3) were fully removed. We recommend
  migrating to role variables which are documented [here](./docs/pages/access-controls/guides/role-templates.mdx)

* Resource names (like roles, connectors, trusted clusters) can no longer
  contain unicode or other special characters. Update the names of all user
  created resources to only include characters, hyphens, and dots.

* `advertise_ip` has been deprecated and replaced with `public_addr` setting. See [#1803](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/1803)
  The existing configuration files will still work, but we advise Teleport
  administrators to update it to reflect the new format.

* Teleport no longer uses `boltdb` back-end for storing cluster state _by
  default_.  The new default is called `dir` and it uses simple JSON files
  stored in `/var/lib/teleport/backend`. This change applies to brand new
  Teleport installations, the existing clusters will continue to use `boltdb`.

* The default set of enabled cryptographic primitives has been
  updated to reflect the latest state of SSH and TLS security. [#1856](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/1856).

#### Bug Fixes

The list of most visible bug fixes in this release:

* `tsh` now properly handles Ctrl+C [#1882](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/1882)
* High CPU utilization on ARM platforms during daemon start-up. [#1886](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/1886)
* Terminal window size can get out of sync on AWS. [#1874](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/1874)
* Some CLI commands print errors twice. [#1889](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/1889)
* SSH session playback can be interrupted for long sessions. [#1774](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/1774)
* Processing `HUP` UNIX signal is unreliable when `teleport` daemon runs under `systemd`. [#1844](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/1844)

## 2.5.0

This is a major release of Teleport. Its goal is to make cloud-native
deployments easier. Numerous AWS users have contributed feedback to this
release, which includes:

#### New Features

* Auth servers in highly available (HA) configuration can share the same `/var/lib/teleport`
  data directory when it's hosted on NFS (or AWS EFS).
  [#1351](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/1351)

* There is now an AWS reference deployment in `examples/aws` directory.  It
  uses Terraform and demonstrates how to deploy large Teleport clusters on AWS
  using best practices like auto-scaling groups, security groups, secrets
  management, load balancers, etc.

* The Teleport daemon now implements built-in connection draining which allows
  zero-downtime upgrades.
  [See documentation](https://gravitational.com/teleport/docs/admin-guide/#graceful-restarts).

* Dynamic join tokens for new nodes can now be explicitly set via `tctl node add --token`.
  This allows Teleport admins to use an external mechanism for generating
  cluster invitation tokens.
  [#1615](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/1615)

* Teleport now correctly manages certificates for accessing proxies behind a
  load balancer with the same domain name. The new configuration parameter
  `public_addr` must be used for this.
  [#1174](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/1174).

#### Improvements

* Switching to a new TLS-based auth server API improves performance of large clusters.
  [#1528](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/1528)

* Session recordings are now compressed by default using gzip. This reduces storage
  requirements by up to 80% in our real-world tests.
  [#1579](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/1528)

* More user-friendly authentication errors in Teleport audit log helps Teleport admins
  troubleshoot configuration errors when integrating with SAML/OIDC providers.
  [#1554](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/1554),
  [#1553](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/1553),
  [#1599](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/1599)

* `tsh` client will now report if a server's API is no longer compatible.

#### Bug Fixes

* `tsh logout` will now correctly log out from all active Teleport sessions. This is useful
  for users who're connected to multiple Teleport clusters at the same time.
  [#1541](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/1541)

* When parsing YAML, Teleport now supports `--` list item separator to create
  multiple resources with a single `tctl create` command.
  [#1663](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/1663)

* Fixed a panic in the Web UI backend [#1558](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/1558)

#### Behavior Changes

Certain components of Teleport behave differently in version 2.5. It is important to
note that these changes are not breaking Teleport functionality. They improve
Teleport behavior on large clusters deployed on highly dynamic cloud
environments such as AWS. This includes:

* Session list in the Web UI is now limited to 1,000 sessions.
* The audit log and recorded session storage has been moved from `/var/lib/teleport/log`
  to `/var/lib/teleport/log/<auth-server-id>`. This is related to [#1351](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/1351)
  described above.
* When connecting a trusted cluster users can no longer pick an arbitrary name for them.
  Their own (local) names will be used, i.e. the `cluster_name` setting now defines how
  the cluster is seen from the outside.
  [#1543](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/1543)

## 2.0.5

Teleport 2.0.5 contains a variety of security fixes. We strongly encourage anyone running Teleport 2.0.0 and above to upgrade to 2.0.5.

The most pressing issues (a phishing attack which can potentially be used to extract plaintext credentials and an attack where an already authenticated user can escalate privileges) can be resolved by upgrading the web proxy. However, however all nodes need to be upgraded to mitigate all vulnerabilities.

* Patch for TLP-01-004: Always check is namespace is valid.
* Patch for TLP-01-005: Check user principal when joining session.
* Patch for TLP-01-006 and TLP-01-007: Validate Session ID.
* Patch for TLP-01-008: Use a fake hash for password authentication if user does not exist.
* Patch for TLP-01-009: Command injection in scp.
