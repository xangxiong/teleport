title: Labels
description: Labeling Teleport resources
---

Teleport allows you to add arbitrary key-value pairs to applications, servers,
databases, and other resources in your cluster. You can use these to filter
resources when making queries via `tctl` and `tsh` as well as to limit the
resources that Teleport roles can access.

This guide explains how to add labels to Teleport resources.

There are two kinds of labels:

### Static labels

Static labels are hardcoded in a `teleport` daemon's configuration file and do
not change over time while the `teleport` process is running. An example of a static
label is a Node's environment, e.g., `staging` vs. `production`.

### Dynamic labels

Dynamic labels, also known as **label commands**, allow you to generate labels
at runtime. The `teleport` daemon will execute an external command on its host
at a configurable frequency and the output of the command becomes the label's
value.

This is especially useful for decoupling the label's value from your Teleport
configuration. For example, if you start Teleport on an Amazon EC2 instance, you
can set a `region` label based on a command that sends a request to the EC2
[instance metadata API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instancedata-data-categories.html).
This means that you can keep your configuration the same for each Node (and set
the configuration within an Amazon Machine Image) while enabling users to search for Nodes by AWS
region.

## Prerequisites

(!docs/pages/includes/edition-prereqs-tabs.mdx!)

(!docs/pages/includes/tctl.mdx!)

- A host where you will run a Teleport Node. In this guide, we will apply labels
  to this Node.

<Admonition title="Resources you can label" type="tip">

You can label any resource managed by Teleport using the instructions in this
guide. See the following guides for how to add resources to a Teleport cluster:

|Guide|Notes on labeling|
|---|---|
|[Applications](../../application-access/getting-started.mdx)||
|[Databases](../../database-access/getting-started.mdx)|Teleport can discover some AWS-hosted databases automatically. In this case, labels will also be automatically applied. |
|[Kubernetes clusters](../../kubernetes-access/getting-started.mdx)||
|[Servers](../../server-access/getting-started.mdx)||
|[Windows desktops](../../desktop-access/getting-started.mdx)|Dynamic labels are not supported for Windows desktops. See our [Desktop Access documentation](../../desktop-access/rbac.mdx#labeling) for how to label desktops.|

## Step 1/3. Prepare your Node

### Install Teleport on your Node

On the host where you will run your Teleport Node, follow the instructions for
your environment to install Teleport.

(!docs/pages/includes/install-linux.mdx!)

### Generate a token

On your local machine, use the `tctl` tool to generate an invite token that your
Node will use to join the cluster. In the following example, a new token is
created with a TTL of five minutes:

```code
# Generate a short-lived invitation token for a new node:
$ tctl nodes add --ttl=5m --roles=node
# The invite token: (=presets.tokens.first=)

# You can also list all generated non-expired tokens:
$ tctl tokens ls
# Token                            Type            Expiry Time
# ------------------------         -----------     ---------------
# (=presets.tokens.first=)         Node            25 Sep 18 00:21 UTC
```

Copy the token. On the remote host that you will add to your Teleport cluster as a
Node, assign the token to an environment variable:

```code
$ export INVITE_TOKEN=<token>
```

We will use this in the next step.

## Step 2/3. Apply a static label to your Node

You can configure Node labels by editing Teleport's configuration file, then
starting Teleport.

On the host where you will run your Node, paste the following content into
`/etc/teleport.yaml` and adjust it for your environment:

<ScopedBlock scope={["oss", "enterprise"]}>

```yaml
version: v3
teleport:
  # The address of your Auth Service.
  auth_server: tele.example.com:3025
  # Or, you can also use a Proxy Service
  # address, e.g., tele.example.com:443, if your Auth Service is not
  # exposed to the internet.
  proxy_server: tele.example.com:443

auth_service:
  enabled: false

proxy_service:
  enabled: false

ssh_service:
  enabled: true
  # Static labels are simple key/value pairs:
  labels:
    environment: dev
```

</ScopedBlock>
<ScopedBlock scope={["cloud"]}>

```yaml
version: v3
teleport:
  # Your Teleport Cloud tenant address
  proxy_server: mytenant.teleport.sh:443

auth_service:
  enabled: false

proxy_service:
  enabled: false

ssh_service:
  enabled: true
  # Static labels are simple key/value pairs:
  labels:
    environment: dev
```

</ScopedBlock>

Next, start Teleport with the invite token you created earlier:

```code
$ sudo teleport start --token=${INVITE_TOKEN?}
```

Verify that you have added the label by running the following on your local
machine. Your Teleport user must be authorized to access the Node.

```code
$ tsh ls --query 'labels["environment"]=="dev"'
Node Name    Address    Labels
------------ ---------- ---------------
bdcb47b87ad6 ‚üµ Tunnel environment=dev
```

<Details title="Don't see your Node?" opened={false}>

First, check the logs for your Node to ensure the SSH Service is running. Your logs should resemble the following:

```text
2022-04-27T14:44:23Z INFO [NODE:1]    Service is starting in tunnel mode. service/service.go:1993
2022-04-27T14:44:23Z INFO [PROC:1]    The new service has started successfully. Starting syncing rotation status with period 10m0s. service/connect.go:482
2022-04-27T14:44:23Z INFO             Service has started successfully. service/service.go:523
2022-04-27T14:44:24Z INFO [NODE:PROX] Connected. addr:172.17.0.2:40184 remote-addr:192.0.2.0:443 leaseID:1 target:teleport.example.com:443 reversetunnel/agent.go:409
```

Next, ensure that your Teleport user has a login that corresponds to a user on
your Node.

Run the following command to get the current logins for your user:

<ScopedBlock scope={["oss", "enterprise"]}>

```code
$ tsh status
> Profile URL:        https://teleport.example.com:443
  Logged in as:       myuser
  Cluster:            teleport.example.com
  Roles:              access, editor
  Logins:             -teleport-nologin-d4bc1dad-ce49-4bbe-925d-a67f8d2d6afe
  Kubernetes:         enabled
  Valid until:        2022-04-27 22:26:50 -0400 EDT [valid for 11h40m0s]
  Extensions:         permit-agent-forwarding, permit-port-forwarding, permit-pty
```

</ScopedBlock>
<ScopedBlock scope={["cloud"]}>

```code
tsh status
> Profile URL:        https://mytenant.teleport.sh:443
  Logged in as:       myuser
  Cluster:            mytenant.teleport.sh
  Roles:              access, editor
  Logins:             -teleport-nologin-d4bc1dad-ce49-4bbe-925d-a67f8d2d6afe
  Kubernetes:         enabled
  Valid until:        2022-04-27 22:26:50 -0400 EDT [valid for 11h40m0s]
  Extensions:         permit-agent-forwarding, permit-port-forwarding, permit-pty
```

</ScopedBlock>

In this example, `-teleport-nologin-d4bc1dad-ce49-4bbe-925d-a67f8d2d6afe` means
that no logins have been assigned to the user.

To add logins, retrieve your user configuration as YAML:

```code
# Replace "myuser" with your Teleport username
$ tctl get user/myuser > user.yaml
```

Edit the `logins` field for your user. Each login must exist as a user on the
host:

```diff
     db_users: null
     kubernetes_groups: null
     kubernetes_users: null
-    logins: null
+    logins:
+      - root
     windows_logins: null
 version: v2
```

Apply your changes:

```code
$ tctl create -f user.yaml
user "myuser" has been updated
```

Log out of your cluster, then log in again. You should now see your Node when
you run `tsh ls`.

## Step 3/3. Apply dynamic labels via commands

Before following this step, stop Teleport on your Node.

As with static labels, you can apply dynamic labels by editing the
Teleport configuration file.

Edit `/etc/teleport.yaml` to define a `commands` array as shown below:

<ScopedBlock scope={["oss", "enterprise"]}>

```yaml
version: v3
teleport:
  auth_server: tele.example.com:3025

auth_service:
  enabled: false

proxy_service:
  enabled: false

ssh_service:
  enabled: "yes"
  # Configure dynamic labels using the "commands" field:
  commands:
  - name: hostname
    command: [hostname]
    period: 1m0s
  - name: arch
    command: [uname, -p]
    # This setting tells Teleport to execute the command above
    # once an hour. This value cannot be less than one minute.
    period: 1h0m0s
```

</ScopedBlock>
<ScopedBlock scope={["cloud"]}>

```yaml
version: v3
teleport:
  proxy_server: mytenant.teleport.sh:443

auth_service:
  enabled: false

proxy_service:
  enabled: false

ssh_service:
  enabled: "yes"
  # Configure dynamic labels using the "commands" field:
  commands:
  - name: hostname
    command: [hostname]
    period: 1m0s
  - name: arch
    command: [uname, -p]
    # This setting tells Teleport to execute the command above
    # once an hour. This value cannot be less than one minute.
    period: 1h0m0s
```

</ScopedBlock>

Notice that the `command` setting is an array where the first element
is a valid executable and each subsequent element is an argument.

This is valid syntax:

```yaml
command: ["/bin/uname", "-m"]
```

This is invalid syntax:

```yaml
command: ["/bin/uname -m"]
```

If you want to pipe several bash commands together, here's how to do it. Notice
how `'` and `"` are interchangeable, so you can use them for nested quotations.

```yaml
command: ["/bin/sh", "-c", "uname -a | egrep -o '[0-9]+\\.[0-9]+\\.[0-9]+'"]
```

<Notice type="warning">

When configuring a command to generate dynamic labels, the executable named
within your command must be the path to a valid file. The executable permission
bit must be set and shell scripts must have a
[shebang line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_\(Unix\)).

</Notice>

Once you have configured your labels, start Teleport with the invite token you
created earlier:

```code
$ sudo teleport start --token=${INVITE_TOKEN?}
```

Verify that you have added the labels by running the following on your local
machine. Your Teleport user must be authorized to access the Node.

```code
$ tsh ls
Node Name         Address    Labels
----------------- ---------- ---------------
ip-192-0-2-0      ‚üµ Tunnel arch=x86_64,hostname=ip-172-30-156-233
```

<Details title="Problems re-joining the Node?">

Try creating another invite token using the `tctl nodes add` command from earlier
and starting your Node again.

If this doesn't work, delete the directory your Node uses to maintain its state,
`/var/lib/teleport`, and try again.

</Details>


## Next steps: Using labels

Once you have labeled your resources, you can refer to your labels when running
`tsh` and `tctl` commands to filter the resources that the commands will query.
For more information, see
[Resource filtering](../../reference/predicate-language.mdx).

You can also use labels to limit the access that different roles have to
specific classes of resources. For more information, see
[Teleport Role Templates](../../access-controls/guides/role-templates.mdx).
