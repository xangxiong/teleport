title: Upgrading a Teleport Cluster
description: How to upgrade Teleport components
---

In this guide, we will show you how to upgrade all of the components in your
Teleport cluster.

(!docs/pages/includes/cloud/call-to-action.mdx!)

## Production releases

<Notice type="warning">
  Avoid running pre-releases (release candidates) in production environments.
</Notice>

The Teleport development team uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/),
which makes it easy to tell if a specific version is recommended for production
use.

## Component compatibility

title="Auth Service and Proxy Service versions">

In Teleport Cloud, we manage the Auth and Proxy Services for you. You can
determine the current version of these services by running the following
command, where `mytenant` is the name of your Teleport Cloud tenant:

```code
$ curl -s https://mytenant.teleport.sh/webapi/ping | jq '.server_version'
```

Read the following rules to ensure that your Teleport resource services (e.g.,
the SSH Service and Database Service) are compatible with the Teleport Auth and
Proxy Services. You should check the version of the Auth and Proxy Services
regularly to make sure that your Teleport resource services are compatible.

## Backup

Back up before upgrading. We have more instructions in [Backing up Teleport](./backup-restore.mdx).

## Upgrade Sequence

<Tabs>
<TabItem scope={["enterprise", "oss"]} label="Self-Hosted">
When upgrading a single Teleport cluster:

1. **Upgrade the Auth Service first**. The Auth Service keeps the cluster state
   and, if there are data format changes introduced in the new version, will
   perform necessary migrations.
2. Upgrade Proxy Service instances. These are stateless and can be upgraded in
   any sequence or at the same time.
3. Finally, upgrade your Teleport resource services in any sequence or at the
   same time.

<Admonition
  type="warning"
  title="Warning"
>
  If several Auth Service instances are running in the High Availability configuration
  (for example, in an AWS Auto Scaling group), you must shrink the group to
  **just one Auth Service** before performing an upgrade.

While Teleport will attempt to perform any necessary migrations, we recommend users create a backup of their backend before upgrading the Auth Server as a
precaution. This allows for a safe rollback in case the migration itself fails.

</Admonition>

When upgrading multiple clusters:

1. First, upgrade the root cluster, i.e. the one that other clusters trust.
2. Upgrade the Trusted Clusters.

</TabItem>
<TabItem scope={["cloud"]} label="Teleport Cloud">

The Teleport Auth Service and Proxy Service are upgraded automatically. When
upgrading resource services, you may upgrade in any sequence or at the same
time.

When upgrading multiple clusters:

1. First, upgrade the root cluster, i.e. the one that other clusters trust.
2. Upgrade the Trusted Clusters.
