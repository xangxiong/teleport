title: Access Requests with Mattermost
description: How to set up Teleport's Mattermost plugin for privilege elevation approvals.
---

This guide will explain how to set up Teleport with Mattermost, an open source
messaging platform. Teleport's Mattermost integration allows teams to approve or
deny Teleport Access Requests using Mattermost, making it easier to implement
security best practices without compromising productivity.

Here is example of sending an Access Request via Teleport's Mattermost
plugin:

  />

  <source
    src="../../../img/enterprise/plugins/mattermost/mattermost.webm"
    type="video/webm"
  />

  Your browser does not support the video tag.

## Prerequisites

(!/docs/pages/includes/commercial-prereqs-tabs.mdx!)

- A Mattermost account with admin privileges. This plugin has been tested with
  Mattermost v7.0.1.
- Either a Linux host or Kubernetes cluster where you will run the Mattermost plugin.

(!docs/pages/includes/tctl.mdx!)

## Step 1/8. Define RBAC resources

Before you set up the Mattermost plugin, you will need to enable Role Access
Requests in the Proxy or Auth Service.

(!/docs/pages/includes/plugins/editor-request-rbac.mdx!)

## Step 2/8. Install the Teleport Mattermost plugin

<ScopedBlock scope={["enterprise", "oss"]}>

We recommend installing Teleport plugins on the same host as the Teleport Proxy
Service. This is an ideal location as plugins have a low memory footprint, and
will require both public internet access and Teleport Auth Service access.

</ScopedBlock>

<ScopedBlock scope="cloud">

Install the Teleport Mattermost plugin on a host that can access both your
Teleport Proxy Service and your Mattermost deployment.

</ScopedBlock>

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Download">
  ```code
  $ curl -L -O https://get.gravitational.com/teleport-access-mattermost-v(=teleport.plugin.version=)-linux-amd64-bin.tar.gz
  $ tar -xzf teleport-access-mattermost-v(=teleport.plugin.version=)-linux-amd64-bin.tar.gz
  $ cd teleport-access-mattermost
  $ ./install
  ```
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="From Source">
  To install from source you need `git` and `go` installed. If you do not have Go installed, visit the Go [downloads page](https://go.dev/dl/).

  ```code
  # Checkout teleport-plugins
  $ git clone https://github.com/gravitational/teleport-plugins.git
  $ cd teleport-plugins/access/mattermost
  $ make
  ```
Run `./install` from `teleport-mattermost` or place the executable in the appropriate `/usr/bin` or `/usr/local/bin` on the server installation.
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Docker">
  ```code
  $ docker pull public.ecr.aws/gravitational/teleport-plugin-mattermost:(=teleport.plugin.version=)
  ```
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Helm Chart">
  ```code
  $ helm repo add teleport (=teleport.helm_repo_url=)
  $ helm repo update
  ```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Step 3/8. Create a user and role for the plugin

(!docs/pages/includes/plugins/rbac.mdx!)

## Step 4/8. Export the access plugin identity

(!docs/pages/includes/plugins/identity-export.mdx!)

## Step 5/8. Register a Mattermost bot

Now that you have generated the credentials your plugin needs to connect to your
Teleport cluster, register your plugin with Mattermost so it can send Access
Request messages to your workspace.

In Mattermost, click the menu button in the upper left of the UI, then click
System Console → Integrations → Bot Accounts.

Set "Enable Bot Account Creation" to "true".

![Enable Mattermost bots](../../../img/enterprise/plugins/mattermost/mattermost_admin_console_integrations_bot_accounts.png)

This will allow you to create a new bot account for the Mattermost plugin.

Go back to your team. In the menu on the upper left of the UI, click
Integrations → Bot Accounts → Add Bot Account.

Set the "Username", "Display Name", and "Description" fields according to how
you would like the Mattermost plugin bot to appear in your workspace. Set "Role"
to "Member".

You can <a href="../../../img/enterprise/plugins/teleport_bot@2x.png"
download>download</a> our avatar to set as your Bot Icon.

Set "post:all" to "Enabled".

![Enable Mattermost Bots](../../../img/enterprise/plugins/mattermost/mattermost_bot.png)

Click "Create Bot Account". We will use the resulting OAuth 2.0 token when we
configure the Mattermost plugin.

## Step 6/8. Configure the Mattermost plugin

At this point, you have generated credentials that the Mattermost plugin will use
to connect to Teleport and Mattermost. You will now configure the Mattermost
plugin to use these credentials and post messages in the right channels for your
workspace.

<Tabs dropdownCaption="Environment type" dropdownSelected="Executable">
<TabItem label="Command Line" options="Executable">
The Mattermost plugin uses a config file in TOML format. On the host where you
will run the Mattermost plugin, generate a boilerplate config by running the
following commands:

```code
$ teleport-mattermost configure > teleport-mattermost.toml
$ sudo mv teleport-mattermost.toml /etc
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Self-Hosted" options="Helm Chart">
The Mattermost Helm Chart uses a YAML values file to configure the plugin. On
the host where you have Helm installed, create a file called
`teleport-mattermost-helm.yaml` based on the following example:

```yaml
(!examples/resources/plugins/teleport-mattermost-helm-self.yaml!)
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Teleport Cloud" options="Helm Chart">
The Mattermost Helm Chart uses a YAML values file to configure the plugin. On
the host where you have Helm installed, create a file called
`teleport-mattermost-helm.yaml` based on the following example:

```yaml
(!examples/resources/plugins/teleport-mattermost-helm-cloud.yaml!)
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Edit the configuration as explained below:

### `[teleport]`

<Tabs dropdownCaption="Environment type" dropdownSelected="Executable">
<TabItem label="Teleport Enterprise" scope={["oss", "enterprise"]} options="Executable">

**`addr`**: Include the hostname and HTTPS port of your Teleport Proxy Service
(e.g., `teleport.example.com:443`). If you are configuring your plugin to
connect directly to the Teleport Auth Service, use your Auth Service's gRPC
endpoint (e.g., `teleport.example.com:3025`).

**`identity`**, **`client_key`**, **`client_crt`**, **`root_cas`**: The values
you will use for these fields depend on whether the Mattermost plugin will
connect to the Proxy Service or the Auth Service.

If you exported an identity file earlier, fill in the `identity` field with the
path to the file and comment out the other fields.

If you exported a client key, client certificate, and root CAs earlier, fill in
the `client_key`, `client_crt`, and `root_cas` fields with the paths to these
files and leave `identity` commented out.

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Teleport Cloud" scope="cloud" options="Executable">

**`addr`**: Include the hostname and HTTPS port of your Teleport Cloud tenant
(e.g., `teleport.example.com:443`).

**`identity`**, **`client_key`**, **`client_crt`**, **`root_cas`**: Fill in the
`identity` field with the path to the identity file you exported earlier and
comment out the other fields.

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Teleport Enterprise " scope={["oss", "enterprise"]} options="Helm Chart">

**`address`**: Include the hostname and HTTPS port of your Teleport Cloud tenant
(e.g., `teleport.example.com:443`).

**`identitySecretName`**: Fill in the `identitySecretName` field with the name
of the Kubernetes secret you created earlier.

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Teleport Cloud " scope="cloud" options="Helm Chart">

**`address`**: Include the hostname and HTTPS port of your Teleport Cloud tenant
(e.g., `teleport.example.com:443`).

**`identitySecretName`**: Fill in the `identitySecretName` field with the name
of the Kubernetes secret you created earlier.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>


### `[mattermost]`

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Executable" scope={["oss", "enterprise"]}>

**`url`**: Include the scheme (`https://`) and fully qualified domain name of
your Mattermost deployment.

**`token`**: Find your Mattermost bot's OAuth 2.0 token. To do so, visit
Mattermost. In the menu on the upper left of the UI, go to Integrations → Bot
Accounts. Find the listing for the Teleport plugin and click "Create New Token".
After you save the token, you will see a message with text in the format,
"Access Token: TOKEN". Copy the token and paste it here.

**`recipients`**: This field configures the channels that the Mattermost plugin
will notify when it receives an Access Request message. The value is an array of
strings, where each element is either:

- The email address of a Mattermost user to notify via a direct message when the
  plugin receives an Access Request event
- A channel name in the format `team/channel`, where `/` separates the name
  of the team and the name of the channel

For example, this configuration will notify `first.last@example.com` and
the `Town Square` channel in the `myteam` team of any Access Request events:

```toml
recipients = [
  "myteam/Town Square",
  "first.last@example.com"
]
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Helm Chart" scope={["oss", "enterprise"]}>

**`url`**: Include the scheme (`https://`) and fully qualified domain name of
your Mattermost deployment.

**`token`**: Find your Mattermost bot's OAuth 2.0 token. To do so, visit
Mattermost. In the menu on the upper left of the UI, go to Integrations → Bot
Accounts. Find the listing for the Teleport plugin and click "Create New Token".
After you save the token, you will see a message with text in the format,
"Access Token: TOKEN". Copy the token and paste it here.

**`recipients`**: This field configures the channels that the Mattermost plugin
will notify when it receives an Access Request message. The value is an array of
strings, where each element is either:

- The email address of a Mattermost user to notify via a direct message when the
  plugin receives an Access Request event
- A channel name in the format `team/channel`, where `/` separates the name
  of the team and the name of the channel

For example, this configuration will notify `first.last@example.com` and
the `Town Square` channel in the `myteam` team of any Access Request events:

```yaml
recipients:
  - "myteam/Town Square"
  - first.last@example.com
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

You will need to invite your Teleport plugin to any channel you add to the
`recipients` list (aside from direct message channels). Visit Mattermost,
navigate to each channel you want to invite the plugin to, and enter `/invite
@teleport` (or the name of the bot you configured) into the message box.

![Invite the bot](../../../img/enterprise/plugins/mattermost/add-bot.png)

<Details title="Suggested reviewers">

Users can also suggest reviewers when they create an Access Request, e.g.,:

```code
$ tsh request create --roles=dbadmin --reviewers=alice@example.com,ivan@example.com
```

If an Access Request includes suggested reviewers, the Mattermost plugin will
add these to the list of channels to notify. If a suggested reviewer is an email
address, the plugin will look up the the direct message channel for that address
and post a message in that channel.

If `recipients` is empty, and the user requesting elevated privileges has not
suggested any reviewers, the plugin will skip forwarding the Access Request to
Mattermost.

</Details>

The final configuration should look similar to this:

<Tabs dropdownCaption="Environment type" dropdownSelected="Executable">
<TabItem scopes={["cloud"]} label="Connect to the Proxy Service" options="Executable">
```yaml
# example mattermost configuration TOML file
[teleport]
auth_server = "myinstance.teleport.sh:443"                   # Teleport Cloud proxy HTTPS address
identity = "/var/lib/teleport/plugins/mattermost/auth.pem"   # Identity file path

[mattermost]
url = "https://mattermost.example.com" # Mattermost Server URL
token = "api-token"                    # Mattermost Bot OAuth token

## Step 7/8. Test your Mattermost bot


<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Executable" scope={["oss", "enterprise"]}>
After modifying your configuration, run the bot with the following command:

```code
$ teleport-mattermost start -d
```

The `-d` flag provides debug information to make sure the bot can connect to
Mattermost, e.g.:

```text
DEBU   Checking Teleport server version mattermost/main.go:234
DEBU   Starting a request watcher... mattermost/main.go:296
DEBU   Starting Mattermost API health check... mattermost/main.go:186
DEBU   Starting secure HTTPS server on :8081 utils/http.go:146
DEBU   Watcher connected mattermost/main.go:260
DEBU   Mattermost API health check finished ok mattermost/main.go:19
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Helm Chart" scope={["oss", "enterprise"]}>
After modifying your configuration, run the bot with the following command:

```code
$ helm upgrade --install teleport-plugin-mattermost teleport/teleport-plugin-mattermost --values teleport-mattermost-helm.yaml
```

To inspect the plugin's logs, use the following command:

```code
$ kubectl logs deploy/teleport-plugin-mattermost
```

Debug logs can be enabled by setting `log.severity` to `DEBUG` in
`teleport-mattermost-helm.yaml` and executing the `helm upgrade ...` command
above again. Then you can restart the plugin with the following command:

```code
$ kubectl rollout restart deployment teleport-plugin-mattermost
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Create an Access Request

(!docs/pages/includes/plugins/create-request.mdx!)

The users and channels you configured earlier to review the request should
receive a message from "Teleport" in Mattermost allowing them to visit a link in
the Teleport Web UI and either approve or deny the request.

### Resolve the request

(!docs/pages/includes/plugins/resolve-request.mdx!)

<Admonition title="Auditing Access Requests">

When the Mattermost plugin posts an Access Request notification to a channel,
anyone with access to the channel can view the notification and follow the link.
While users must be authorized via their Teleport roles to review Access
Requests, you should still check the Teleport audit log to ensure that the right
users are reviewing the right requests.

When auditing Access Request reviews, check for events with the type `Access
Request Reviewed` in the Teleport Web UI <ScopedBlock scope={["oss",
"enterprise"]}>and `access_request.review` if reviewing the audit log on the
Auth Service host</ScopedBlock>.

</Admonition>

## Step 8/8. Set up systemd

In production, we recommend starting the Teleport plugin daemon via an init
system like systemd. Here's the recommended Teleport plugin service unit file
for systemd:

```ini
(!examples/systemd/plugins/teleport-mattermost.service!)
```

Save this as `teleport-mattermost.service` in either `/usr/lib/systemd/system/` or
another [unit file load
path](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.unit.html#Unit%20File%20Load%20Path)
supported by systemd.

Enable and start the plugin:

```code
$ sudo systemctl enable teleport-mattermost
$ sudo systemctl start teleport-mattermost
```
