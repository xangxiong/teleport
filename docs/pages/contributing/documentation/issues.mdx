description: Guidelines for creating Teleport documentation issues on GitHub
---

When you notice that something is vague, inaccurate, or incomplete about the
documentation, or have an idea for a great guide, we encourage you to create a
GitHub issue.

[Issue: Documentation](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/new?assignees=&labels=documentation&template=documentation.md)

To help us organize our time responding to issues and pull requests, please add
the `documentation` label if you are proposing or making a change to the
documentation.
