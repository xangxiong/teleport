Download the latest version of Teleport for your platform from our [downloads page](https://goteleport.com/teleport/download)
and follow the installation [instructions](../../installation.mdx).

## Start Auth/Proxy service

Create a configuration file for a Teleport service that will be running
auth and proxy servers:

```yaml
teleport:
  data_dir: /var/lib/teleport
auth_service:
  enabled: "yes"
proxy_service:
  enabled: "yes"
  # Set public address proxy will be reachable at.
  public_addr: teleport.example.com:3080
ssh_service:
  enabled: "no"
```

(!docs/pages/includes/permission-warning.mdx!)

Start the service:

```code
$ sudo teleport start --config=/path/to/teleport.yaml
```

### Generate a token

A join token is required to authorize a Teleport Application Proxy service to
join the cluster. Generate a short-lived join token and save it for example
in `/tmp/token`:

```code
# Log in to your cluster with tsh so you can use tctl from your local machine.
# You can also run tctl on your Auth Service host without running "tsh login"
# first.
$ tsh login --user=myuser --proxy=teleport.example.com
$ tctl tokens add \
    --type=app \
    --app-name=grafana \
    --app-uri=http://localhost:3000
```

### TLS requirements

TLS is required to secure Teleport's Access Plane and any connected
applications. When setting up Teleport, the minimum requirement is a certificate
for the proxy and a wildcard certificate for its sub-domain. This is where
everyone will log into Teleport.

<Admonition type="tip" title="Application Access and DNS">
(!docs/pages/includes/dns-app-access.mdx!)
</Admonition>

In our example:

- `teleport.example.com` will host the Access Plane.
- `*.teleport.example.com` will host all of the applications e.g. `grafana.teleport.example.com`.

You can either configure Teleport to obtain a TLS certificate via Let's Encrypt or use an existing certificate and private key (e.g. using [certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/)).
<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Let's Encrypt">
(!docs/pages/includes/acme.mdx!)
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Existing Credentials">
If you have obtained certificate/key pairs for your domain they can be provided directly
to the proxy service:

```yaml
proxy_service:
  enabled: "yes"
  web_listen_addr: "0.0.0.0:443"
  public_addr: "teleport.example.com:443"
  https_keypairs:
  - key_file: "/etc/letsencrypt/live/teleport.example.com/privkey.pem"
    cert_file: "/etc/letsencrypt/live/teleport.example.com/fullchain.pem"
  - key_file: "/etc/letsencrypt/live/*.teleport.example.com/privkey.pem"
    cert_file: "/etc/letsencrypt/live/*.teleport.example.com/fullchain.pem"
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Create a user

A Teleport user needs their role's permission to access an application. Teleport
comes with a built-in `access` role that grants access to all apps:

```code
$ tctl --config=/path/to/teleport.yaml users add --roles=access appuser
```

## Start application service with CLI flags

Install Teleport:

(!docs/pages/includes/install-linux.mdx!)

You can start the Teleport Application Service with a single CLI command:

```code
$ sudo teleport start \
    --roles=app \
    --token=/tmp/token \
    --auth-server=teleport.example.com:3080 \
    --app-name="grafana" \
    --app-uri="http://localhost:3000" \
    --labels=env=dev
```

Note that the `--auth-server` flag must point to the Teleport cluster's proxy
endpoint because the application service always connects back to the cluster over
a reverse tunnel.

### Application name

An application name should make a valid sub-domain (\<=63 characters, no spaces, only `a-z 0-9 -` allowed).

After Teleport is running, users can access the app at `app-name.proxy_public_addr.com`
e.g. `grafana.teleport.example.com`. You can also override `public_addr` e.g
`grafana.acme.com` if you configure the appropriate DNS entry to point to the
Teleport proxy server.

## Start application service with a config file

Example `teleport.yaml` configuration:

```yaml
version: v3
teleport:
  # Data directory for the Application Proxy service. If running on the same
  # node as Auth/Proxy service, make sure to use different data directories.
  data_dir: /var/lib/teleport-app
  # Instructs the service to load the join token from the specified file
  # during initial registration with the cluster.
  join_params:
    join_method: token
    token_name: /tmp/token
  # Proxy address to connect to. Note that it has to be the proxy address
  # because the app service always connects to the cluster over a reverse
  # tunnel.
  proxy_server: teleport.example.com:3080
app_service:
    enabled: yes
    # Teleport provides a small debug app that can be used to make sure application
    # access is working correctly. It'll output JWTs so it can be useful
    # when extending your application.
    debug_app: true
    # This section contains definitions of all applications proxied by this
    # service. It can contain multiple items.
    apps:
      # Name of the application. Used for identification purposes.
    - name: "grafana"
      # URI and port the application is available at.
      uri: "http://localhost:3000"
      # Optional application public address to override.
      public_addr: "grafana.teleport.example.com"
      # Optional static labels to assign to the app. Used in RBAC.
      labels:
        env: "prod"
      # Optional dynamic labels to assign to the app. Used in RBAC.
      commands:
      - name: "os"
        command: ["/usr/bin/uname"]
        period: "5s"
auth_service:
  enabled: "no"
ssh_service:
  enabled: "no"
proxy_service:
  enabled: "no"
```

Start the application service:

```code
$ sudo teleport start --config=/path/to/teleport.yaml
```

## Advanced options

### Running the debug application

For testing and debugging purposes, we provide a built-in debug app. It can
be turned on using `debug_app: true`.

```yaml
app_service:
   enabled: yes
   debug_app: true
```

The app will dump all the request headers in the response.

### Customize public address

By default applications are available at `<app-name>.<proxy-host>:<proxy-port>`
address. To override the public address, specify the `public_addr` field:

```yaml
- name: "jira"
  uri: "https://localhost:8001"
  public_addr: "jira.example.com"
```

### Skip TLS certificate verification

<Admonition
  type="warning"
  title="Danger Zone"
>
  This is insecure and not recommended for use in production.
</Admonition>

Teleport checks if the certificates presented by the applications are signed
by a trusted Certificate Authority. When using self-signed certificates for
internal applications, use `insecure_skip_verify: true` to skip this
verification step:

```yaml
- name: "app"
  uri: "https://localhost:8443"
  public_addr: "app.example.com"
  insecure_skip_verify: true
```

### Deeplink to a subdirectory

Some applications are available in a subdirectory. Examples include the
[Kubernetes Dashboard.](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/web-ui-dashboard/).
The URI should be updated to include the subdirectory:

```yaml
- name: "k8s"
  uri: "http://10.0.1.60:8001/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/https:kubernetes-dashboard:/proxy/#/overview?namespace=default"
  public_addr: "k8s.example.com"
```

### Rewrite redirect

To support web apps that perform internal redirects, application access
provides an option to rewrite the hostname of the `Location` header on
redirect responses to the application's public address:

```yaml
- name: "jenkins"
  uri: "https://localhost:8001"
  public_addr: "jenkins.example.com"
  rewrite:
    # Rewrite the "Location" header on redirect responses replacing the
    # host with the public address of this application.
    redirect:
    - "localhost"
    - "jenkins.internal.dev"
```

### Headers passthrough

You can configure application access to inject additional headers in the
requests forwarded to a web application.

```yaml
- name: "dashboard"
  uri: https://localhost:4321
  public_addr: dashboard.example.com
  rewrite:
    headers:
    # Inject a static header.
    - "X-Custom-Header: example"
    # Inject headers with internal/external user traits.
    - "X-Internal-Trait: {{internal.logins}}"
    - "X-External-Trait: {{external.env}}"
    # Inject header with Teleport-signed JWT token.
    - "Authorization: Bearer {{internal.jwt}}"
    # Override Host header.
    - "Host: dashboard.example.com"
```

Headers injected this way override any headers with the same names that may
be sent by an application. The following headers are reserved and can't be
rewritten: `Teleport-Jwt-Assertion`, `Cf-Access-Token`, and any `X-Forwarded-*`.

Rewritten header values support the same templating variables as [role templates](../../access-controls/guides/role-templates.mdx).
In the example above, `X-Internal-Trait` header will be populated with the value
of internal user trait `logins` and `X-External-Trait` header will get the value
of the user's external `env` trait coming from the identity provider.

Additionally, the `{{internal.jwt}}` template variable will be replaced with
a JWT token signed by Teleport that contains user identity information. See
[Integrating with JWTs](../jwt/introduction.mdx) for more details.

## View applications in Teleport

Teleport provides a UI for quickly launching connected applications.

They can be viewed by navigating to a cluster's web UI and selecting the "Applications" tab.
The URL structure looks like this:

`https://[cluster-url:cluster-port]/web/cluster/[cluster-name]/apps`

## Logging out of applications

When you log into an application, you'll get a certificate and login session
per your defined RBAC. If you want to force log out before this period you can
do so by hitting the `/teleport-logout` endpoint:

- `https://internal-app.teleport.example.com/teleport-logout`
