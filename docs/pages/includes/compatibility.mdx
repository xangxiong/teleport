When running multiple `teleport` binaries within a cluster, the following rules
apply:

- **Patch and minor** versions are always compatible, for example, any 8.0.1
  component will work with any 8.0.3 component and any 8.1.0 component will work
  with any 8.3.0 component.
- Servers support clients that are 1 major version behind, but do not support
  clients that are on a newer major version. For example, an 8.x.x Proxy Service
  is compatible with 7.x.x resource services and 7.x.x `tsh`, but we don't
  guarantee that a 9.x.x resource service will work with an 8.x.x Proxy Service.
  This also means you must not attempt to upgrade from 6.x.x straight to 8.x.x.
  You must upgrade to 7.x.x first.
- Proxy Services and resource services do not support Auth Services that are on
  an older major version, and will fail to connect to older Auth Services by
  default. This behavior can be overridden by passing `--skip-version-check`
  when starting Proxy Services and resource services.
