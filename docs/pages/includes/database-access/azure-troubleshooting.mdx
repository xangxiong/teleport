### No credential providers error

If you see the error `DefaultAzureCredential: failed to acquire a token.` in Database Service logs then Teleport
is not detecting the required credentials to connect to the Azure SDK. Check whether
the credentials have been applied in the machine running the Teleport Database Service and restart
the Teleport Database Service.
Refer to [Azure SDK Authorization](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/go/azure-sdk-authorization)
for more information.

### Timeout errors

The Teleport Database Service needs connectivity to your database endpoints. That may require
enabling inbound traffic on the database from the Database Service on the same VPC or routing rules from another VPC. Using the `nc`
program you can verify connections to databases:

```code
$ nc -zv server-name.postgres.database.azure.com 5432
# Connection to server-name.postgres.database.azure.com 5432 port [tcp/postgresql] succeeded!
```
