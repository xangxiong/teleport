This guide explains Enhanced Session Recording for SSH with BPF and how to set
it up in your Teleport cluster.

Teleport's default [SSH and Kubernetes session recording](../../architecture/nodes.mdx#ssh-session-recording)
feature captures what is echoed to a terminal.

This has inherent advantages. For example, because no input is captured, Teleport
session recordings typically do not contain passwords that were entered into a terminal.

The disadvantage is that there are several techniques for rendering session
recordings less useful:

- **Obfuscation**. For example, even though the command
  `echo Y3VybCBodHRwOi8vd3d3LmV4YW1wbGUuY29tCg== | base64 --decode | sh` does not contain
  `curl http://www.example.com`, when decoded, that is what is run.
- **Shell scripts**. For example, if a user uploads and executes a script, the commands run within the script are not captured, only the output.
- **Terminal controls**. Terminals support a wide variety of controls including the ability for users to disable terminal echo. This is frequently used when requesting credentials. Disabling terminal echo allows commands to be run without being captured.

Furthermore, due to their unstructured nature, session recordings are difficult to
ingest and perform monitoring and alerting on.

Teleport Enhanced Session Recording mitigates all three concerns by providing advanced security and greater logging capabilities, and better correlates a user with their activities.

<Admonition type="warning" title="Security Warning">

Teleport Enhanced Session Recording does not provide a secure environment on
its own and is not a substitute for a Linux Security Module (SELinux, AppArmor,
etc.). It must be paired with reasonable system hardening practices to enforce
a trusted host environment, including proper access control on core system
binaries and libraries and well-designed user management.

Note that privileged users (either as root or via `sudo`) can interfere with
session recording activities (such as unloading/disabling the necessary
libraries, altering how Teleport is run, tampering with kernel functionality,
creating tunnels, or just performing actions outside of the restricted
session). Also, a local user with both monitored and unmonitored console
sessions or ptrace privileges may not be fully captured in recordings.

Commands executed via daemons (systemd, crond, atd, etc.) could be outside of
the recorded session scope. Proper network-based restrictions for ingress
traffic must also be implemented to prevent possible unauthorized data transfer.

Additionally, certain forensic information such as full binary paths
(accounting for any potential symbolic links), any modifications via shared
library preloading, and environment variables may not be captured in session recordings.

## Prerequisites

(!docs/pages/includes/edition-prereqs-tabs.mdx!)

- At least one host that you will use to run the Teleport Node Service. The host
  must run Linux kernel 5.8 (or above).

  You can check your kernel version using the `uname` command. The output should look
  something like the following.

  ```code
  $ uname -r
  # 5.8.17
  ```

  See below for more details on the required versions for your Linux kernel and
  distribution.

<Notice type="tip">

  Our Standard Session Recording works with older Linux kernels. View
  [Teleport Nodes](../../architecture/nodes.mdx#ssh-session-recording) for more
  details.

</Notice>

### Linux distributions and supported kernels

## Step 1/2. Configure a Teleport Node

### Install Teleport on your Node

<ScopedBlock scope={["oss", "enterprise"]}>

On the host where you will run your Teleport Node, follow the instructions for
your environment to install Teleport.

(!docs/pages/includes/install-linux.mdx!)

</ScopedBlock>
<ScopedBlock scope={["cloud"]}>

(!docs/pages/includes/install-agent-cloud.mdx!)

</ScopedBlock>

### Generate a token

Use the `tctl` tool to generate an invite token that your Node will use to join
the cluster. In the following example, a new token is created with a TTL of five
minutes:

```code
# Generate a short-lived invitation token for a new node:
$ tctl nodes add --ttl=5m --roles=node
# The invite token: (=presets.tokens.first=)

# You can also list all generated non-expired tokens:
$ tctl tokens ls
# Token                            Type            Expiry Time
# ------------------------         -----------     ---------------
# (=presets.tokens.first=)         Node            25 Sep 18 00:21 UTC

# ... or revoke an invitation token before it's used:
$ tctl tokens rm (=presets.tokens.first=)
```

### Create a configuration file

Set up your Teleport Node with the following content in `/etc/teleport.yaml`.

```yaml
# Example config to be saved as etc/teleport.yaml
version: v3
teleport:
  nodename: graviton-node
  # The token you created earlier
  join_params:
    join_method: token
    token_name: (=presets.tokens.first=)

  # Replace with the address of the Teleport Auth Service
  auth_server: 127.0.0.1:3025
  # Or specify the Proxy Service address.
  proxy_server: 127.0.0.1:3080

  data_dir: /var/lib/teleport
proxy_service:
  enabled: false
auth_service:
  enabled: false
ssh_service:
  enabled: true
  enhanced_recording:
    # Enable or disable enhanced auditing for this node. Default value: false.
    enabled: true

    # Optional: command_buffer_size is optional with a default value of 8 pages.
    command_buffer_size: 8

    # Optional: disk_buffer_size is optional with default value of 128 pages.
    disk_buffer_size: 128

    # Optional: network_buffer_size is optional with default value of 8 pages.
    network_buffer_size: 8

    # Optional: Controls where cgroupv2 hierarchy is mounted. Default value:
    # /cgroup2.
    cgroup_path: /cgroup2
```

### Start Teleport on your Node

```code
$ teleport start
```

## Step 2/2. Inspect the audit log

<Tabs>
<TabItem scope={["oss", "enterprise"]} label="Self-Hosted">

Enhanced session recording events will be shown in Teleport's audit log, which
you can inspect by visiting Teleport's Web UI.

Events emitted via Enhanced Session Recording will include the
`"enhanced_recording": true` field in events similar to the following:

```json
{
  "code": "T2004I",
  "ei": 23,
  "enhanced_recording": true,
  "event": "session.end",
  "interactive": true,
  "namespace": "default",
  "participants": [
    "benarent"
  ],
  "server_id": "585fc225-5cf9-4e9f-8ff6-1b0fd6885b09",
  "sid": "ca82b98d-1d30-11ea-8244-cafde5327a6c",
  "time": "2019-12-12T22:44:46.218Z",
  "uid": "83e67464-a93a-4c7c-8ce6-5a3d8802c3b2",
  "user": "benarent"
}
```

If your Teleport cluster uses a file-based event log, you can examine your audit
log on the Teleport Auth Service host.

<Details title="Is my cluster using a file-based event log?" opened={false}>

Teleport's session recordings backend is configured via the
`teleport.storage.audit_sessions_uri` field. If a provided URI includes a scheme
that belongs to a cloud-based service (e.g., `s3://` or `dynamodb://`), you will
not be able to inspect session recordings in the filesystem of your Auth Service
host.

</Details>

Examine the contents of `/var/lib/teleport/log` as shown below:

```code
$ teleport-auth ~:  tree /var/lib/teleport/log
# /var/lib/teleport/log
# ├── 1048a649-8f3f-4431-9529-0c53339b65a5

# ├── events.log -> /var/lib/teleport/log/1048a649-8f3f-4431-9529-0c53339b65a5/2020-01-13.00:00:00.log
# ├── playbacks
# │   └── sessions
# │       └── default
# └── upload
#    └── sessions
#        └── default
```

To quickly check the status of the audit log, you can simply tail the logs with
`tail -f /var/lib/teleport/log/events.log`. The resulting capture from Teleport will
be a JSON log for each command and network request.
