## teleport.yaml

Teleport uses the YAML file format for configuration. A full configuration reference
file is shown below, this provides comments and all available options for `teleport.yaml`
By default, it is stored in `/etc/teleport.yaml`.

- **Do not use this example configuration in production.**

  You must edit your configuration file to meet the needs of your environment.
  Using a copy of the reference configuration will have unintended effects. To
  create a configuration file that you can use as a starting point, run the
  following command:

  ```code
  $ teleport configure -o file
  ```

- You should back up your configuration file before making changes. This will
  enable you to roll back to the previous configuration if you need to.
