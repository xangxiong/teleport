description: How to use Teleport's health, readiness, profiling, and monitoring endpoints.
---

Teleport provides HTTP endpoints for monitoring purposes. They are disabled by
default, but you can enable them using the `--diag-addr` flag when running
`teleport start`:

```code
$ sudo teleport start --diag-addr=127.0.0.1:3000
```

Now you can collect monitoring information from several endpoints.

## `/healthz`

The `http://127.0.0.1:3000/healthz` endpoint responds with a body of
`{"status":"ok"}` and an HTTP 200 OK status code if the process is running.

This is a simple check, suitable for determining if the Teleport process is
still running.

## `/readyz`

The `http://127.0.0.1:3000/readyz` endpoint is similar to `/healthz`, but its
response includes information about the state of the process.

The response body is a JSON object of the form:

```
{ "status": "a status message here"}
```

### `/readyz` and heartbeats

If a Teleport component fails to execute its heartbeat procedure, it will enter
a degraded state. Teleport will begin recovering from this state when a
heartbeat completes successfully.

The first successful heartbeat will transition Teleport into a recovering state.

A second consecutive successful heartbeat will cause Teleport to transition to
the OK state.

Teleport heartbeats run approximately every 60 seconds when healthy, and failed
heartbeats are retried approximately every 5 seconds. This means that depending
on the timing of heartbeats, it can take 60-70 seconds after connectivity is
restored for `/readyz` to start reporting healthy again.

### Status codes

The status code of the response can be one of:

- HTTP 200 OK: Teleport is operating normally
- HTTP 503 Service Unavailable: Teleport has encountered a connection error and
  is running in a degraded state. This happens when a Teleport heartbeat fails.
- HTTP 400 Bad Request: Teleport is either entering its initial startup phase or
  has begun recovering from a degraded state.

The same state information is also available via the `process_state` metric
under the `/metrics` endpoint.

## `/debug/pprof`

The `http://127.0.0.1:3000/debug/pprof/` endpoint is Go's standard pprof
profiler. This endpoint is only available if the `--debug` (or `-d`) flag is
supplied (in addition to `--diag-addr`).

## `/metrics`

The `http://127.0.0.1:3000/metrics` endpoint serves the internal metrics
Teleport is tracking. It is compatible with
[Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) collectors.

The following metrics are available:

Teleport Cloud does not expose monitoring endpoints for the Auth Service and Proxy Service.
